                        Departure is a strong indicates for the strength and market share of different commercial airlines in different regions as Atlantic, Latin America, Pacific, domestic and international. Additionally, miles is also important indexes for operation comparison. Departures and miles used for ridership analysis shows the popularity and development trend in each market. Network carriers increased average departures which reached up to 1.3 millions in both domestic and international regions for recent years.

                        The Covid-19 crisis has created an unexpected and unpredicted damage for commercial airlines in all regions. It is forecasted that it would take nearly 4 years to fully recovery for airline industry back to pre-pandemic level.

                  <h3>Load Factor (LF)</h3>
                  <p> <b>Load Factor </b> Load factor represents the proportion of airline output that is actually consumed. To calculate this figure, divide RPMs by ASMs.  Load factor for a single flight can also be calculated by dividing the number of passengers by the number of seats.</p>
                  <p>
                     Both network carriers and value carriers increased their domestic load factor by over 20% for the 25-year period. Great performance could also be detected from international operations. By effectively managing the capacity and seasonality, network carriers gain the ability to match frequency and capacity growth with passenger travel demand. Network carriers had the widest business markets by providing services in Pacific and Atlantic regions where ultra-low-cost carrier had not broken in yet. The high load factors from those two regions demonstrates the network carriers' abilities to expand and activate business globally. However, unexpected Covid hit in 2020, the average LF of all there airline groups decreased sharply to around 60%, the worst in 20 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Domestic load factor for ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) had been growing significantly over the past two decades with a disruption in 2001. Then it kept improving and reached to the peak as 89% in 2013. This group also increased international load factors as well as Latin America ones. The average LF of ULCCs in 2020 was 66%, as worse as in 2001.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Value carriers increased average load factors at a faster speed than network carriers did in international, Latin America and Pacific operation regions over the period of past 25 years. They both reached around 85% load factors for the recent years in all three regions. At the same time, significant average domestic load factor improvements were made by both sets of carriers. For Atlantic operations, network carriers continued reducing load factor variation by improving asset utilization and adjusting schedule corresponding seasonality, which was a strong evident of their remarkable operation management. The average LF of value carriers in 2020 was the lowest compared to other two groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Average domestic load factor of network carriers increased from 65.7% in 1995 to 87% in 2019. Over the past 25 years, value carriers improved its domestic load factor by nearly 17%, 2% lower than network carriers as of 2019. By continually reducing seasonality, value carriers might further improve load factor and eventually outrun all counterparts in domestic region. Ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) had the biggest increase in domestic load factor due to their efficiency to satisfy more leisure passengers and meet seasonality.

                     In order to build travelers' confidence in traveling during and post-pandemic, US commercial airlines should improve visible health and cleaning protocols for better safer travels. More and more people expect to travel for leisure after the infections decline completely. Rising demand on leisure travels will drive transportation recovery dramatically in future with more and more people getting vaccinated.

                        Network Carrier ASM had been trending upwards tremendously since 2011, which relied heavily on increasing international operations. As of 2019, United ASM reached the peak as of 253 billion and Delta 251 billion. Almost doubled ASMs for network carriers over the past ten years was caused mainly by increasing capacity in both domestic and international regions. However, Untied ASM dropped to 104 billions and Delta 120 billions, decreased by almost 60%.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Value carriers had been increasing ASMs nonstop and expanding market share in almost all regions, especially in domestic and international. As of 2019, Southwest as a major leader among value carriers developed a successful business model proved by significant increasing ASMs which soared up to 157 billion. Load factors spurred big gain in the long term as well. JetBlue ASMs boosted tremendously from 1.38 billion in 2000 to 63 billion in 2019. In 2020, Southwest ASM decreased to 103 billions and JetBlue 33 billions.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        ASMs had been soaring up to sky over the last two decades for ultra-low-cost carriers with the fastest-growing which now could account for 7% of total US commercial airline revenue. Since 2011, Ultra-low-cost carriers ASMs followed a similar pattern with significant capacity growth like other value carriers. During the 2008 economic crisis, travel demand for Frontier and Spirit spiked up and they both increased international and domestic capacity which drove up ASMs but slow down yield growth. As of 2019, ASMs of Allegiant, Frontier and Spirit grew up to $13.3, $30.5 and $46.5 billion respectively, compared their base lines $0.02, $1.3 and $0.8 billion in 1995.

                        Network carriers had reduced aircraft ownership of small aircrafts and increased large ones over the past 25-year period before 2020. From the aircraft ownership, it was obvious that ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) had been expanding the percentage of large aircrafts and reducing the number of small narrowbodies as they focusing more on domestic travels by serving large amount of leisure travelers. The number of widebody aircrafts was too small to be detected from the dashboard, which had everything to do with company strategies of better curtailing cost and addressing needs from domestic travelers.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Taking a closer look at ultra-low-cost carriers, Frontier and Spirit shared the same trending pattern of starting business with small narrowbodies first and increasing percentage of large narrowbodies more and more later as they successfully found good positions where they could compete with other value or even network carriers. It indicated that ultra-low-cost carriers took the similar strategies to expand market share while at the same time maximizing productivity by adjusting budgets.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Comparing the aircraft ownership structures of two value carriers Hawaiian and Southwest, it was obvious that Southwest owned the most of small narrowbody aircrafts and Hawaiian focused on purchasing widebodies. Hawaiian is known as providing intra-island service with long hauls between the United States mainland and Hawaiian Islands, which makes this airline special with big demands on widebody aircrafts. Southwest as a leader and major inspiration to other value carriers has been focusing on domestic region by using competitive strategies of reducing aircraft turnaround time and combining high productivity and low cost by small narrowbody aircrafts. As JetBlue and Alaska improving amenities and customer services to gain market share as value carriers, they shift the major aircraft ownership from small narriowbodies to large ones.

                     <p>
                        Network carriers’ total maintenance fee had been above 2 billion since 2011. In general, aircraft maintenance cost represented more than ten percent of total operating cost for network carriers. The portion used on large narrowbody aircrafts (typically 151 seats or more in a two-class configuration) was growing nonstop given the strategy shift to offer more low-fare flights for leisure travels. Labor is one of the biggest costs for all commercial airlines. Network carriers spent more and more on pilots and relative staffs. During the 2008 economic crisis, labor cost dropped as expected but caught up at a slow and steady rate since 2010.

                  <p>
                     Compared to other carriers, network carriers operated more in large regions like international, Latin America, Atlantic and Pacific. The pressure of fuel cost could be imaged as higher during the period of high fuel prices. After a 10-year depression from 2003 to 2011, network carriers fuel cost kept to a stable level above 3 billion by using new aircrafts to improve fuel efficiency as well as upgrading fleets to narrow fuel cost gap to other low-cost carriers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Value carriers used to have a fuel cost advantage because of their newer fleets. Putting aside of this, value carriers had another advantage of using fuel-efficient, high-tech small narrowbody aircrafts to customize travel needs and meet seasonality. Since 2000, the number of large narrowbody aircrafts had been increasing quickly as value carriers successfully captured big revenue from nonticket charges and service fees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Fuel consumption kept growing at a surprising rate for ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) which had been expanding market share and increasing the number of large narrowbody aircrafts rapidly. In 2019, more than 75% of aircrafts used by ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) were large narrowbodies which certainly consumed much more fuel for every departure. However, fuel efficiency was definitely improved since new aircrafts with advanced technology replaced old ones
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Over the past 25 years before 2020, value carriers fuel consumption increased at a relatively stable rate consistently compared to other two groups. The average growth rate of network carriers was lowest as expected given the large scope of their business base. Still their fuel consumption increased nonstop at a slow and reasonable rate corresponding to the growing operating revenue since 2010. Annual total amount of fuel consumption of ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) fluctuate frequently and dramatically due to their evolving of market strategies and airline structure. During pandemic, airline industry fuel consumption has been decreasing which reflects operation reduction due to collapse in travel demand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In 2020, fuel comsumption dropped significantly due to the low demand in all regions, especially international.
